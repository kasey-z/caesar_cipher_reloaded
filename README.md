# Caesar Cipher reloaded

- This is a project for [the Odin Project, Sinatra Project course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-project).

- The purpose of the project is to use Sinatra to set up the app very easily. It has only one function that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified encrypted string.

- It has been deployed to [Heroku](https://hidden-wildwood-20236.herokuapp.com/).
